# Authentication/Login-Signup-Logout API using Express.js, MongoDB, and JWT

This repository contains an authentication/login-signup-logout API created using Express.js, MongoDB, and JWT (JSON Web Token). You can use this API to implement user authentication and registration in your applications.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the API on your local machine: (because it is a server side code so running the server is must)

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
   git clone https://github.com/Bilalzafar0020/Authentication-with-express-mongodb-jwt.git
   

2. **Open in Visual Studio Code**: Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code or any preferred code editor.

3. **Install Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

4. **Install Dependencies**: Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code and navigate to the project folder. Run the following command to initialize the project and install required dependencies:
   
  (1)    npm init
  (2)    npm install express
   

5. **Create Environment Variables**: Rename the `.env_template` file to `.env` and set your own secret key. Replace the placeholder value with your actual secret key:
   
   SECRET=your-secret-key
  

6. **Run the Server**: In the terminal, run the following command to start the server:
   
   node app.js
or
npm run dev 

7. **Access the API**: Open your web browser and navigate to (http://localhost:3001/)
